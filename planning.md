# Plan

1. *Create `planning.md`.* I will create a new file named `planning.md` and write the plan for the current task into it.
2. *Update `AGENTS.md`.* I will add a new instruction to `AGENTS.md` to use `planning.md` for planning and tracking progress.
3. *Complete pre commit steps.* I will complete pre commit steps to make sure proper testing, verifications, reviews and reflections are done.
4. *Submit the changes.* Once the files are created and updated, I will submit the changes with a descriptive commit message.
